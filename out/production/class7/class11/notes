2D Arrays are arrays that contain 1D Arrays
they allow us to store multiple 1D arrays which gives us more flexibility to store data.
for example if we have to store data from Exel files we can use 2D Arrays
SYNTAX to create 2D arrays
first way
DataType[][] nameOfArray=new DataType[SizeofRows][];
second way
DataType[][] nameOfArray= {{data,data,data},{data,data},{data,data,data,data}};

OOP   OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING
is nothing but some set of rules that if we follow we achieve below.
1).representing real life entities become easier.
2).  Code repetition id minimized
3). Changing existing code and adding new features become easier
4). helps write secure code
5).


Object-oriented programming is a way to write computer programs using "objects" which are like little toy models of
real-world things.
 Each object has its own little set of instructions called "methods" that tell it what to do, and it also has its own
  little bits of information called "properties" or "attributes" that describe it.

For example, let's say we want to make a toy car. We can create a "Car" class which is like a blueprint for the toy car.
It will have instructions for things like driving and honking and it also has properties like "color" and
"numberOfWheels". Then we can use that blueprint to make many toy cars, each one can be different, like one can be red
 and one can be blue. and each one will have its own set of instructions and information.

Java is a programming language that uses object-oriented programming, which means we can use classes and objects
 to make our programs.

It's like legos, you have a lego instruction set and each lego piece has its own set of properties, and you use
them to build something new and unique.                                (i asked open ai to explain me most basic way)
